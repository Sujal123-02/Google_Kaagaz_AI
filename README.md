📄 Google Kaagaz AI: Your Secure, Intelligent Life-Graph
Google Kaagaz AI is a hyper-secure, multimodal "Life Operating System" powered by Gemini 2.0 Pro. It transforms a user’s chaotic pile of digital documents into an organized, active, and reasoning database.

"Effectively placing a secure, intelligent 'Secretary' in the pocket of every Indian."

🚀 The Problem & Solution
The Problem: The average Indian is overwhelmed by "Data Chaos"—scattered documents across physical files and digital folders leading to missed deadlines and unclaimed benefits.

The Solution: Google Kaagaz AI fuses the reasoning power of Gemini 2.0 Pro with Triple-Lock Security (Google, Phone, Aadhaar). It transforms static files into an active "Life Knowledge Graph" that answers complex queries and proactively manages life’s deadlines.

✨ Core Features
🧠 Cross-Document Reasoning: The system connects isolated dots (e.g., combining Income + Caste + Academic records) to answer queries like "Am I eligible for this scholarship?"
🔐 Triple-Lock Security: Authenticate via Google OAuth, Phone OTP, and verified Aadhaar e-KYC (Simulation).
📅 Active Nudges: Auto-extracts dates (Insurance renewals, Warranty expiry) and syncs them to Google Calendar.
🛡️ Secure "Time-Bomb" Sharing: Generate document links that self-destruct after 15m, 30m, 1h, or a single view.
📁 Personal Drive Storage: All documents stay in the user's private Google Drive; we provide the intelligence without "owning" the data.
🛠️ Technical Stack
Frontend: HTML5, Tailwind CSS, Animate.css
Backend/Hosting: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Hosting, Storage)
AI Engine: Gemini 2.0 Pro (Multimodal Document Extraction)
APIs: Google Drive API, Google Calendar API
Design System: DigiLocker-inspired "Bharat" Aesthetic (Maroon & Beige)
